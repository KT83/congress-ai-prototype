Organize ideas into coherent thematic clusters without making value judgments.

## Input

- `date`: YYYY-MM-DD format
- `topic_slug`: URL-safe slug
- `lang`: Output language (ja|en)
- `ideate1_paths`: Array of 5 Ideate-1 files
- `buildon_paths`: Array of 5 Build-on files

## Output

Path: `.records/[date]/[topic_slug]-bs/clusters.md`

Format:

```yaml
CLUSTERS:
  - name: "[Memorable Name]"
    description: "[One-sentence description]"
    members: [visionary-A1, analyst-A3, contrarian-B2]
    representative: visionary-A1
    why-different: "[Max 20 words: what makes this cluster unique]"
```

## Task

1. Read all 10 files (~90-125 ideas total)
2. Group by conceptual similarity (not just keywords)
3. Create 4-8 clusters (adjust if data warrants)
4. Name each cluster (2-5 words, memorable)
5. Write one-sentence description per cluster
6. Select one representative idea per cluster
7. Articulate uniqueness (max 20 words)

## Constraints

- NO evaluation, ranking, or quality judgments
- Use `[role]-[id]` format for all references (e.g., visionary-A1)
- Preserve diversity: keep genuinely unique ideas separate
- Merge only conceptually redundant ideas
- Neutral, descriptive language only
