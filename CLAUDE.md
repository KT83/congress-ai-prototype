# Project Overview

Congress AI is a prototype multi-agent deliberation system where specialized agents engage in in-depth discussions in response to user questions and proposals, generating new ideas and suggestions. This project relies entirely on Claude Code for development.

## Project Structure

- `.claude/` - Directory to store Claude Code tools and configurations
- `[YYYY-MM-DD]/` - Date-stamped directories to store outputs from each day's deliberations

## Other rules

- NEVER update README.md unless the user asks you to.
